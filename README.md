# Abstract


### What is Abstract?

<p>It is a open source protocol which can be implemented by any app or website. It's based on the idea of creating an abstraction layer between users and their social media platforms.</p>


### Purpose of Abstract?

<p>I noticed when I tried to quit youtube and move to another social media platform like oddysee which was completely decentralized and open source, that most of the videos I like to watch were not available on oddysee. I wanted to quit youtube because I was growing tired of their lack of transparency for their recommendations, their constant deranking of certain creators for arbitrary reasons, and their censorious nature. But I couldn't quit because of how no matter how much I disliked youtube, I still had to accept the fact most users and creators still use it. It's gotten to be a monopoly of video content. And many other media sites have a similar problem. (twitter, and facebook for example)</p>
<p>To fix this problem I designed the Abstract Social Media Protocol. It is designed to connect all your social media platforms to one central feed. It aggregates all of them together, and you can add whatever filters you want to it. You can filter out videos, or politics or adult content etc... All by using an open source algorithm that you create. Then to watch or view content, the site opens the functionality of that to you, and allows you to use the platforms api to write like, share, comment or subscribe to a specific piece of content.</p>
<p>My hope is that by doing this, social media platforms will be forced to compete on a level playing field to obtain your viewership and your content. Now, if you see a video from rumble it will appear on your feed alongside a video from youtube, and so you can still watch your favorite youtube videos, but not need to keep switching between apps/websites, since it's all there on one page. This also incentivizes platforms to stop censorship, because the more relevant videos they censor, the more you'll just be recommended that content on other platforms which do not censor.</p>
<p>For too long alternatives which are vastly better than the top social media categories have been way underutilized because once the majority of people start using a social media platform, you would need a exceptionally good reason to get them to move away from it, because that is where everyone is. It is like asking everyone to come to your party, when their party has hundreds of millions more people in it. And more people means more views, and more views means more revenue and attention and ability to market/advertise.</p>


### Goals:
 * Allow users to create their own open-source algorithms for the stuff they see in their feed, and be able to copy someone elses with various preset options available.
 * Aggregate content from each category of social media site based on user preference and their algorithm. The categories go like this: video sharing platforms (youtube, rumble, oddysee), post based platforms (twitter, truth social, minds), social/group platforms (facebook), and short form video/image sharing platforms (tiktok, instagram, pinterest), commenting sites (gab, stack overflow, quora, octal).
 * Allow users to be able to like, comment, share, and subscribe to a piece of content from the main feed page.
 * Allow creators to create universal profiles that get created inside each social media platform, and to have the ability to post content to Abstract and then the api for each of the social media platforms will be utilized to automatically post it to every social media platform the creator wants for that category of content. Creators can obviously choose from a list all the ones they want to automatically post to.


### How it works:

<p>Abstract protocol has many built-in algorithms and apis for various social media platforms. As more platforms become popular more algorithms can be added by users and merged to the source repo. The algorithms will be different for each platform depending on the api's that platform uses. This allows anyone to update the algorithm of a specific platform without messing up the algorithm of other platforms/media categories. It then produces a feed which can be viewed in any ui or dashboard created by whatever app implements this protocol.</p>
<p>The protocol can be implemented in any app, especially any decentralized app. The app I plan to make for it will also be called Abstract. It will be a decentralized app built off the Abstract Social Media Protocol.</p>
